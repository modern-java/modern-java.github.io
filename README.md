- [Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/)
> Dropwizard is a Java framework for developing ops-friendly, high-performance, RESTful web services

- [Play](https://www.playframework.com/)
> The High Velocity Web Framework For Java and Scala

- [Spark](https://sparkjava.com/)
> Spark - A micro framework for creating web applications in Kotlin and Java 8 with minimal effort

- [Sling](https://sling.apache.org/)
> Apache Sling™ is a framework for RESTful web-applications based on an extensible content tree

- [Wicket](https://wicket.apache.org/)
> The Apache Wicket project announces the 9th major release of the open source Java web framework servicing websites and applications across the globe since 2004. Built on top of Java 11, this version of Wicket brings web development into the modern Java world, offering a fundamental tool to keep you code up to date with Java's evolution

### ORM Frameworks
- [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/)
> Hibernate ORM is an object–relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database

- [OpenJPA](https://openjpa.apache.org/)
> Apache OpenJPA is a Java persistence project at The Apache Software Foundation that can be used as a stand-alone POJO persistence layer or integrated into any Java EE compliant container and many other lightweight frameworks, such as Tomcat and Spring

- [EclipseLink](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/)
> Comprehensive open-source Java persistence solution addressing relational, XML, and database web services

### Frontend Frameworks
- [Vaadin](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin)
> This package contains all Vaadin web components (free and commercial)

### Web Scraping
- [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/)
> jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for fetching URLs and extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors

### Messaging Queue
- [JMS](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-message-service.html)
> The Java Message Service (JMS) API is a messaging standard that allows application components based on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to create, send, receive, and read messages. It enables distributed communication that is loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous

- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
> Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications

- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
> RabbitMQ is the most widely deployed open source message broker

- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
> The open source, in-memory data store used by millions of developers as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker

### Frameworks for Microservice
- [Helidon](https://helidon.io/)
> Helidon is a cloud-native, open‑source set of Java libraries for writing microservices that run on a fast web core powered by Netty

### Metrics and Performance
- [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/)
> Micrometer provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems, allowing you to instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in. Think SLF4J, but for metrics

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
> Power your metrics and alerting with the leading open-source monitoring solution

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
> Compose and scale observability with one or all pieces of the stack

### Profiling
- [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/)
> VisualVM is a visual tool integrating commandline JDK tools and lightweight profiling capabilities.
Designed for both development and production time use

### Concurrency
- [Project Loom](https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/)
> The goal of this Project is to explore and incubate Java VM features and APIs built on top of them for the implementation of lightweight user-mode threads (fibers), delimited continuations (of some form), and related features, such as explicit tail-call

- [Disruptor](https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/)
> LMAX aims to be the fastest trading platform in the world. Clearly, in order to achieve this we needed to do something special to achieve very low-latency and high-throughput with our Java platform. Performance testing showed that using queues to pass data between stages of the system was introducing latency, so we focused on optimising this area

### Scheduler
- [Quartz](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/)
> Quartz is a richly featured, open source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java application - from the smallest stand-alone application to the largest e-commerce system

### Template Engines
- [Themeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)
> Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments

- [Apache Velocity](https://velocity.apache.org/)
> Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use a simple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in Java code

- [FreeMaker](https://freemarker.apache.org/)
> Apache FreeMarker™ is a template engine: a Java library to generate text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files, source code, etc.) based on templates and changing data

### Sockets
- [RSocket](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket)
> RSocket is an application protocol providing Reactive Streams semantics over an asynchronous, binary boundary

### Computer Vision
- [JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv)
> JavaCV uses wrappers from the JavaCPP Presets of commonly used libraries by researchers in the field of computer vision (OpenCV, FFmpeg, libdc1394, FlyCapture, Spinnaker, OpenKinect, librealsense, CL PS3 Eye Driver, videoInput, ARToolKitPlus, flandmark, Leptonica, and Tesseract) and provides utility classes to make their functionality easier to use on the Java platform, including Android

### Machine Learning
- [Tribuo](https://tribuo.org/)
> Tribuo* is a machine learning library written in Java. It provides tools for classification, regression, clustering, model development, and more. It provides a unified interface to many popular third-party ML libraries like xgboost and liblinear. With interfaces to native code, Tribuo also makes it possible to deploy models trained by Python libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, and pytorch) in a Java program. Tribuo is licensed under Apache 2.0
